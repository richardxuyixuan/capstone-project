**To train:**
1. change the codes for L9-11 in train_pipeline.py
2. (optionally) change other args on top of train_pipeline.py
3. (optionally) add a new model in models.py and use that instead
4. Run train_pipeline.py

**To test:**
1. change the codes for L16-18 in eval_pipeline.py
2. (optionally) change other args on top of eval_pipeline.py
3. Run eval_pipeline.py

**Try to improve your models (or at least run both train and eval):**
1. Wendy (caption only)
2. Skyler (image only)
3. Richard (early and late fusion)

**Some strategies to consider:**
1. Try the segmented images  on CNN
