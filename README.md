# capstone-project

**To train:**
1. change the codes for L9-11 in train_pipeline.py
2. (optionally) change other args on top of train_pipeline.py
3. (optionally) add a new model in models.py and use that instead
4. Run train_pipeline.py

**To test:**
1. change the codes for L16-18 in eval_pipeline.py
2. (optionally) change other args on top of eval_pipeline.py
3. Run eval_pipeline.py

**Try to improve your models (or at least run both train and eval):**
1. Wendy (caption only)
2. Skyler (image only)
3. Richard (early and late fusion)

**Some strategies to consider:**
1. Try the segmented images  on CNN

**Things to Try**
Attention mechanism
Focal loss
Weight initialization
Add industry as a feature for ad
User similarity score
Item (ad) similarity score
Data augmentation 
 
Different combination of features
 
Ordinal logistic regression
Fix confusion matrix
P@K with k=number of ads with score 5
DEMO and trying the model on new dataset that we create ourselves
Five classes classification
Serial coeffiicents
Binary → Binary → binary
Leranable thresholds
